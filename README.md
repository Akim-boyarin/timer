# Timer

This app was realized with basic conceptions of OOP, like ***class***, ***object***,  ***inheritance***, ***encapsulation***, with using native JavaScript.    

In particular it has a [class](https://github.com/Akim-boyarin/timer/blob/main/js/classTimer.js) of timer which made object for using in app. Class get differnt functions for working with interface and give three public methods to timer's work. So, we can use the timer, there're buttons to do it. Every button has [event-handler](https://github.com/Akim-boyarin/timer/blob/main/js/buttonsHandlers.js) which starts method of class.

Design of the app is based on Bootstrap library, it's made with using **SCSS** and **BEM-methodology**. Also bundling is realized by Live Sass Compiler.
